# Project Repository

[Event Log project repository](https://github.com/chrisbay/event-log)

The initial commits include a basic "Hello, world!" Spring Boot app. They also add some basic dependencies in the [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/chrisbay/event-log/blob/3f91742a0527a65e64678c477d50f26a98b87f3e/build.gradle) file for jQuery and Bootstrap (from the `org.webjars` group), as well as a testing database engine, H2.
